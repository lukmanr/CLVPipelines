## Provisioning the lightweight Kubeflow Pipelines deployment

To provision the lightweight Kubeflow Pipelines deployment:

1. Select or create a GCP project
1. Make sure that the following Cloud APIs are enabled:
   - Compute Engine
   - Cloud Storage
   - Container Registry
   - Kubernetes Engine
   - BigQuery
   - AutoML
   - Cloud Build
1. Open a new session in **Cloud Shell**
1. Create a working directory and copy to it the `install.sh` script from the `/install` folder of this repo.
1. Start the installation process by executing the following commands:
```
./install.sh [PROJECT_ID] [CLUSTER_NAME] [ZONE] [KFP_SA] [VERSION]

for example:

./install.sh my-project my-cluster us-central1-a kubeflow-pipelines master

```

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
PROJECT_ID|Project ID of the GCP project you selected for the solution
CLUSTER_NAME| The name of the GKE cluster to create. If the cluster with that name already exists the script will skip the creation step.
ZONE | The zone for the cluster. Since AutoML only support` us-central1` it is recommended to create the cluster in one of the zones in the same region
KFP_SA | The name of the service account to be used by Kubeflow Pipelines. If the service account with that name already exists the account is reused.
KFP_VERSION | The version of Kubeflow Pipelines to install. It is recommended to use the latest version from the master branch in Kubeflow Pipelines GitHub repo.

The installation script goes through the following steps.

1. Creates a single-zone, Standard Google Kubernetes Cluster. The nodes in the cluster are configured with the cloud-platform instance scope, which gives the nodes access to all Cloud APIs including BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and AutoML Tables utilized in the solution. All other properties of the cluster are set to defaults.
1. Installs Kubeflow Pipelines into the  `kubeflow` namespace.
1. Creates a service account to be used by KFP
1. Creates a private key for the service account.
1. Stores the key as the user-gcp-sa Kubernetes secret in the kubeflow namespace.
1. Assigns the service account permissions in for BigQuery, Cloud Storage and AutoML Tables.
